# HTML5 Tutorial

## What is HTML5?

Hypertext MarkUp Language is describes the contents in the webpage. HTML is not a language that you download, but more of a **standard** that browsers implement. [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML5) refers to the latest HTML standard established in 2014, as well as some JavaScript APIs.

Given some text, HTML "marks up" that text using *tags* to structure and organize the webpage.

## HTML Basic Elements

Some basic tags for organizing text:
* <p> - paragraph (chunk of content)
* <b> - bring attention to (bold)
* <i> italize
* <ol> - ordered list with <li> list items
* <ul> - unordered list with <li> list items

Sometimes tags have *attributes*, which is information passed to a tag:
* <a href=””> - anchor/link tag 
* <img src=”” alt=””> - image tag w/o closing
